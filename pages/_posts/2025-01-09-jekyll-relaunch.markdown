After 10 years, I decided to update my website. WordPress would be the obvious choice for a
WordPress developer, but after further consideration, I've started with the most straightforward
solution: [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart). They're robust, free, simple,
and versioned, and they allow you to make the
GitHub contribution box greener, bringing you closer to a [$500k offer](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hptjdq/hired_for_500k_without_interview/).

GitHub pages, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
and [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/2.5-stable) documentation are pretty
good ([Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24369257/removing-jekyll-update-from-the-jekyll-urls)
helped as well: ). Let's see if I will need more complex stuff.
